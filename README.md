# Dijkstra's algorithm
This repository is created to make a labyrinth in C++ and than PostProcess results in MATLAB
1. Download repository
2. Put it to the same folder
3. Compile Djikstra.cpp 
4. That exe file will generate random maze with start _point and sizes you define in cpp file
5. After starting exe file it generats files result.txt, visit_matrix.txt and map.txt result and map file need MATLAB script to create results visit file is only for control purposes that code works correctly
6. Than use MATLAB to analyze results of maze generation
